## Contribution Process

1. Create a feature branch containing the changes you'd like to make. Feature branches should be named of the form **feature/xyz**.
2. Open a PR for your change:

- All PRs should be tied back to an issue. If an issue is not already open for the change you are making, please open an [issue](https://github.com/Progressive/oculr-ngx/issues) using one of our provided templates first.
- Ensure the [maintainers](#maintainers) have been added as reviewers for the PR

3. We'll try and have all conversations regarding your PR right in the PR itself. For complex issues, you may initiate an offline conversation, but we must summarize our discussion in the PR before merging.
4. Once the PR has been approved, squash merge into _main_. Delete any remnants of your source branch.
5. That's it!
