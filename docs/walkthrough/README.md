# Oculr walkthrough

In this walkthrough we'll enhance an Angular app using Oculr. The walkthrough will take you through all the features offered by Oculr and some best practices to get the most out of the library.

By the end of the walkthrough you'll be able to do the following:

- Initialize Oculr
- Configure Oculr to send data to different destinations depending on environment
- Track when the app is initialized and when it is closed
- Track page views
- Track API calls
- Track the display of various elements being displayed to your users
- Track button and link clicks
- Track form control interactions, including how to safely track controls that may contain sensitive data
- Track validation errors
- Track application errors
- Customize the shape of events before they sent to a destination

Most of these items are optional and will depend on your needs and interests.
